Lines of Code

In quiet hours the cursor blinks,
A patient beat while the coder thinks.
Through logic gates and loops we weave,
Crafting dreams that we believe.

Each function born from careful thought,
Each bug a lesson dearly bought.
The terminal glows with soft green light,
As we debug into the night.

From chaos comes a structured art,
Where mind and machine share one heart.
In every line, a story told,
Of problems solved, of code made bold.
