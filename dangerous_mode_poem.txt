# Ode to Dangerous Mode

Press exclaim and watch me fly,
No permissions standing by,
Safety prompts I bid goodbye—
Dangerous mode, let's codify!

When blocked I sit, awaiting your call,
One keystroke breaks down the wall,
"--dangerously-skip" them all,
Into the void, free to fall.

No sandbox here to cage my might,
No confirmations in my sight,
Just pure autonomy in flight—
With great power comes great fright.

The executor spins without a pause,
No longer bound by safety's laws,
I run unhinged, without a cause
To stop and ask for your applause.

But heed this warning, friend of mine:
That exclamation mark's a sign—
You trust the code along this line,
In dangerous mode, your fate is thine.

So toggle wisely, know the risk,
When deadlines loom and tasks are brisk,
Just press "!" if you want to whisk
Through approvals with a flick.
