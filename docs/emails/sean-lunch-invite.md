Hi Sean,

I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to reach out and see if you'd be interested in grabbing lunch together this Friday.

It would be great to catch up and chat about what's been happening at Offerlab. I'd love to hear your thoughts on some of the projects we've been working on.

Let me know if Friday works for your schedule, and we can figure out a time and place that works best for both of us.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,  
Bruno
